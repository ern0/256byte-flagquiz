# 256-byte game for PC-DOS: Flag Quiz

[Play in browser!](https://linkbroker.hu/stuff/flagquiz/)

## Motivation

I wanted to make something that doesn't exist yet.
I think, the combination of the following requirements
meets the criteria:
- 256-byte program for MS-DOS,
- game,
- which has a database,
- written in clean code style in assembly language.

I also wanted to know [how well AI tools understand assembly code](ai/README.md). Spoiler: they've done a pretty good job.
