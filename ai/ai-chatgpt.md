# Assembly Program Analysis

## Main Function
This program is a simple quiz that asks the user to guess the Top-Level Domain (TLD) based on a given flag. It:
1. Loads flag data from memory.
2. Displays the flag using graphical routines.
3. Prompts the user to enter a guess.
4. Evaluates the correctness of the guess.
5. Updates the results accordingly.
6. Loops through multiple flag entries before exiting.

## Program Flow
1. **Initialization**: The program starts at `org 100H` and initializes registers `SI` (data source) and `DI` (result storage).
2. **Screen Clearing**: Calls `clear_screen` to reset the display.
3. **Main Loop (next_flag)**:
   - Calls `load_flag_data` to fetch flag details.
   - Calls `display_flag` to render the flag.
   - Calls `read_answer` to get user input.
   - Calls `evaluate_answer` to check correctness.
   - Checks if all flags are processed; loops if not.
4. **Exit**: Calls interrupt `int 20H` to terminate execution.

## Data Format
- `data`: Stores encoded flag data in three-byte sequences.
- `result`: Stores user responses as `NONE_SIGN`, `PASS_SIGN`, or `FAIL_SIGN`.
- `num_pass`: Tracks the number of correct answers.
- `num_round`: Keeps count of rounds played.

## Subroutines
- **clear_screen**: Uses `int 10H` to clear the screen.
- **load_flag_data**:
  - Loads a two-byte color code and a single-byte character.
  - Stores the character in `print_tld`.
- **display_flag**:
  - Calls `display_strip` three times for tricolor rendering.
- **display_strip**:
  - Draws flag segments using BIOS interrupts.
- **read_answer**:
  - Prints a prompt and reads a two-character user input.
- **read_key**:
  - Handles key press detection and ESC key termination.
- **evaluate_answer**:
  - Compares the user input with the correct TLD.
  - Updates `num_pass` and displays feedback.
- **inc2**:
  - Increments numerical counters in `num_pass` and `num_round`.

## Register Usage
- `SI`: Points to flag data.
- `DI`: Points to result storage.
- `BX`: Stores flag colors and numerical values.
- `AX`: Temporary storage for calculations and BIOS calls.
- `CX`: Loop counter for display functions.
- `DX`: Holds addresses for output strings.
- `AH`: Used for BIOS interrupts.
- `AL`: Stores user input and comparison values.

## Conclusion
This program is a simple interactive game that tests the user's knowledge of TLDs. It follows a structured flow with modular subroutines for display, input handling, and evaluation. Registers are used efficiently to manipulate data and interact with BIOS services.
