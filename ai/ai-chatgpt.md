# Analysis of Assembly Program

## Overview
This assembly program appears to display country code top-level domains (TLDs) along with colored stripes in a graphical mode. It uses BIOS and DOS interrupts for handling graphics and text display. The program iterates through a data block, extracts information, and displays TLDs along with corresponding tricolor flags.

## How It Works
1. **Initialize SI with data address:**
   - `lea si,[data]` loads the effective address of the `data` section into `SI`.
2. **Set BP counter to 18:**
   - `mov bp,18` sets the loop counter for processing 18 sets of data.
3. **Process each flag:**
   - Calls BIOS interrupt `int 10H` to set graphics mode.
   - Reads two bytes into `AX` (country code and color info).
   - Manipulates the data (shifts bits, extracts values).
   - Calls `strip` subroutine to draw the tricolor.
   - Prints the extracted TLD string.
   - Waits for a key press (`int 16H`).
   - Exits if `Esc` (ASCII 27) is pressed.
   - Loops until all flags are processed.
4. **Exit:**
   - Uses `int 21H` to terminate the program.

## Data Format
Each TLD entry in the `data` section consists of three bytes:
- **First Byte:** Background color or graphical attribute.
- **Second Byte:** Color information for the stripes.
- **Third Byte:** ASCII character representing the TLD letter.

Example:
```assembly
   db 0a0H, 0cbH, 64H  ; Represents some flag data and 'd'
```

## Subroutines
### `strip`
This subroutine handles drawing the tricolor flag.
- Saves registers with `pusha`.
- Extracts color bits and modifies `BL`.
- Draws vertical color bands using BIOS interrupt `0x10`.
- Restores registers with `popa`.

## Register Usage
- **SI**: Pointer to data.
- **BP**: Loop counter for the number of flags.
- **AX**: General-purpose register used for data manipulation.
- **BX**: Stores color information.
- **CX**: Used as a counter for loops.
- **DI**: Stores the memory location for TLD string storage.
- **DX**: Used for printing messages.

## Conclusion
This program iterates over a dataset, extracts and prints country TLDs, and displays graphical flags using BIOS interrupts. It loops through 18 predefined flag entries and exits upon user input.
