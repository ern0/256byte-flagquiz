# Assembly Program Analysis

## Overview

This is an assembly language program written for x86 architecture in 16-bit mode. The program displays a series of country flags, each with three horizontal colored strips, along with their corresponding TLD (Top-Level Domain). It waits for a key press between each flag display and exits when either all flags have been shown or when the Escape key (ASCII 27) is pressed.

## Program Flow

1. Set the starting address to 0x100H (typical for .COM files)
2. Load the address of the data table into SI register
3. Set a counter (BP) to 18 (total number of flags to display)
4. For each flag:
   - Clear the screen
   - Load flag data (color information and TLD)
   - Display the three-colored strips of the flag
   - Print the TLD of the country
   - Wait for a keypress
   - Exit if ESC is pressed, otherwise continue to next flag
5. Terminate the program

## Data Format

The data for each flag is stored in a simple 3-byte structure:
- First word (2 bytes): Contains color information for the three strips
  - The first 9 bits (lower byte + bit 0 of higher byte) encode the colors
  - Each strip color uses 3 bits, allowing for 8 possible colors per strip
- Third byte: ASCII code for the second character of the TLD
  - The first character of the TLD is derived from the higher byte of the first word

## Subroutines

### strip
This subroutine draws a horizontal strip (band) of the flag in a specific color:
- Inputs: BL register contains color information (only bits 0-2 are used)
- Draws 4 rows of 10 characters each using the BIOS teletype output
- Uses ASCII character 0xDB (â–ˆ) as the drawing element
- After drawing one strip, it clears BL to set color to black before returning

## Register Usage

- SI: Source Index, points to the data being processed
- BP: Base Pointer, used as a counter for the number of flags remaining
- AX: Accumulator, used for multiple purposes:
  - Setting video mode
  - Loading data from memory
  - BIOS/DOS function calls
- BX: Base Register:
  - BL stores color information for flag strips
  - BH is used for video page in BIOS calls
- CX: Counter, used for loop control:
  - CH: Number of rows per strip (4)
  - CL: Number of characters per row (10)
- DI: Destination Index, used for writing to the TLD string

## BIOS/DOS Interrupts Used

- INT 10H, AH=0D: Clear screen (set video mode)
- INT 10H, AH=0E: Teletype output (display character)
- INT 21H, AH=9: Print string (until $ character)
- INT 16H, AH=0: Wait for keypress
- INT 21H, AX=4C00H: Terminate program

## Country Flags Represented

The program displays 18 flags in sequence, each with their corresponding TLD (country code). Based on the data format, these would be various national flags with three horizontal bands of different colors, such as Germany (de), Russia (ru), Austria (at), etc.

## Optimization Note

The program is optimized for compactness, typical of assembly programs from the DOS era. It uses minimal memory and efficient register operations to maximize performance on legacy hardware.
