# Program Analysis

This program is a simple quiz game that tests the user's knowledge of country code top-level domains (TLDs). The user is prompted to guess the TLD for a given country, and the program checks the answer against a predefined list. The program is written in assembly language for the x86 architecture and is designed to run in a DOS environment.

## Program Overview

The program consists of several subroutines that handle different tasks such as clearing the screen, loading data, displaying flags, reading user input, and checking the answers. The program loops through a set of predefined TLDs, displays a flag, and waits for the user to input the correct TLD.

## Data Format

The data section of the program contains the following:

- **COUNT**: A constant set to 17, representing the number of TLDs to be quizzed.
- **data**: A list of encoded TLDs and their corresponding flags. Each entry consists of three bytes:
  - The first byte represents the flag's color.
  - The second byte is part of the TLD encoding.
  - The third byte is the ASCII code for the TLD's first character.

- **print_backspace**, **print_question**, **print_space**, **print_answer**, **print_tld**: Strings used for displaying prompts and messages to the user.
- **result**: A buffer that stores the results of the user's guesses.
- **num**: A string that keeps track of the user's score.

## Subroutines

1. **clear_screen**:
   - Clears the screen by setting the video mode to 13H (320x200, 256 colors).

2. **load_data**:
   - Loads the next TLD and flag data from the `data` section.
   - Processes the data to prepare it for display.

3. **display_flag**:
   - Displays the flag by calling `display_strip` three times (for the three colors in the flag).

4. **display_strip**:
   - Displays a single strip of the flag by printing a block of characters with a specific color.

5. **read_answer**:
   - Prompts the user to guess the TLD.
   - Reads the user's input and checks it against the correct TLD.
   - Updates the score and displays the result.

6. **read_key**:
   - Reads a single key press from the user.
   - If the Escape key (ASCII 27) is pressed, the program exits.

7. **exit**:
   - Terminates the program.

## Register Usage

- **SI**: Source Index register, used to point to the current position in the `data` section.
- **BP**: Base Pointer register, used as a counter to keep track of the current TLD being quizzed.
- **AX**, **BX**, **CX**, **DX**: General-purpose registers used for various calculations and data manipulation.
- **DI**: Destination Index register, used to point to the `print_tld` buffer.
- **AH**, **AL**: High and low bytes of the AX register, used for specific operations like interrupt calls and data manipulation.

## Result

The program will display a series of flags and prompt the user to guess the corresponding TLD. The user's input is checked against the correct TLD, and the score is updated accordingly. The program will loop through all 17 TLDs and then exit.

Here is the expected output format:

```
Guess TLD: [User Input]
? [Result]
```

The `[Result]` will indicate whether the user's guess was correct or not. The program keeps track of the number of correct answers and displays the score at the end.

## Example Output

```
Guess TLD: us
? Correct!
Guess TLD: uk
? Incorrect!
...
Score: 12/17
```

This output shows that the user guessed "us" correctly but "uk" incorrectly, and the final score is 12 out of 17.
