# Assembly Program Analysis

This document provides a detailed explanation of the provided assembly program, including its functionality, data format, subroutines, and register usage.

## Program Overview

The program is written in x86 assembly language and is designed to run in a DOS environment. It displays a series of flags represented by color patterns and prints associated Top-Level Domain (TLD) codes. The program uses BIOS and DOS interrupts for screen manipulation and input/output operations.

## Data Format

The data section contains a series of bytes that represent the color patterns and TLD codes for different flags. Each flag is represented by three bytes:

- **First Byte**: Color pattern for the first stripe.
- **Second Byte**: Color pattern for the second stripe.
- **Third Byte**: ASCII code for the TLD character.

Example:
```assembly
db 0a0H, 0cbH, 64H
```
- `0a0H`: Color pattern for the first stripe.
- `0cbH`: Color pattern for the second stripe.
- `64H`: ASCII code for the TLD character ('d').

## Subroutines

### `strip` Subroutine

This subroutine is responsible for displaying a color strip on the screen. It uses BIOS interrupt `10H` to set the color and display characters.

- **Input**: 
  - `BL`: Contains the color pattern.
- **Output**: 
  - Displays a color strip on the screen.

### `next_tricolor` Loop

This loop iterates three times to display three color strips for each flag. It calls the `strip` subroutine for each iteration.

## Register Usage

- **SI**: Source Index register, used to point to the current position in the data array.
- **BP**: Base Pointer register, used as a counter for the number of flags to display.
- **AX**: Accumulator register, used for various operations including interrupt calls.
- **BX**: Base register, used to hold color patterns and TLD codes.
- **CX**: Counter register, used for loop control.
- **DX**: Data register, used to hold the address of the string to be printed.
- **DI**: Destination Index register, used to point to the `print_tld` buffer.

## Program Flow

1. **Initialization**:
   - Set `SI` to point to the start of the data array.
   - Set `BP` to 18 (number of flags to display).

2. **Main Loop (`next_flag`)**:
   - Clear the screen using BIOS interrupt `10H`.
   - Load the next color pattern and TLD code from the data array.
   - Display the TLD code.
   - Display three color strips by calling the `strip` subroutine in a loop.
   - Print the TLD code string using DOS interrupt `21H`.
   - Wait for a key press. If the pressed key is ESC (ASCII 27), exit the program.
   - Decrement `BP` and repeat the loop if `BP` is not zero.

3. **Exit**:
   - Terminate the program using DOS interrupt `21H`.

## Example Output

For the given data, the program will display 18 flags with their corresponding TLD codes. Each flag will have three color strips, and the TLD code will be printed next to it.

Example:
```
TLD: d
TLD: f
TLD: b
...
```

## Conclusion

This program is a simple yet effective demonstration of using BIOS and DOS interrupts in assembly language to manipulate the screen and handle input/output. It showcases the use of loops, subroutines, and data handling in a low-level programming environment.
