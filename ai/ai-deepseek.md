# Program Explanation

## Main Function
The main function of this program is to display a series of flags, prompt the user to guess the corresponding Top-Level Domain (TLD), evaluate the user's input, and then display the result. The program continues this process until all flags have been displayed and evaluated.

## Program Flow
1. **Initialization**: The program starts by setting up the initial memory locations and constants.
2. **Clear Screen**: The screen is cleared to prepare for displaying the flags.
3. **Main Loop**:
   - **Load Flag Data**: The program loads the next flag data from the `data` section.
   - **Display Flag**: The flag is displayed on the screen.
   - **Read Answer**: The program waits for the user to input their guess for the TLD.
   - **Evaluate Answer**: The user's input is compared against the correct TLD, and the result is recorded.
   - **Check Completion**: If there are more flags to process, the loop continues; otherwise, the program exits.
4. **Exit**: The program terminates.

## Data Format
- **COUNT**: The number of flags to process.
- **NONE_SIGN**: Represents an unanswered question (`.`).
- **PASS_SIGN**: Represents a correct answer (`X`).
- **FAIL_SIGN**: Represents an incorrect answer (`-`).
- **BS, CR, LF, ESC**: Control characters for backspace, carriage return, line feed, and escape, respectively.
- **data**: Contains the encoded flag data.
- **result**: Stores the results of the user's guesses.
- **num_pass**: Tracks the number of correct answers.

## Subroutines
- **clear_screen**: Clears the screen using BIOS interrupt `10H`.
- **load_flag_data**: Loads the next flag data into registers.
- **display_flag**: Displays the flag on the screen.
- **display_strip**: Displays a strip of the flag.
- **read_answer**: Reads the user's input and handles backspace and escape key presses.
- **evaluate_answer**: Compares the user's input with the correct TLD and updates the result.
- **inc2**: Increments a two-digit number stored in memory.

## Register Usage
- **SI**: Source Index register, used to point to the current position in the `data` section.
- **DI**: Destination Index register, used to point to the current position in the `result` section.
- **AX, BX, CX, DX**: General-purpose registers used for various operations, including data manipulation and function calls.
- **AH, AL, BH, BL, CH, CL, DH, DL**: High and low bytes of the general-purpose registers, used for specific operations like interrupts and data storage.

## Result
The program will display a series of flags, prompt the user to guess the corresponding TLD, and then display the results. The results will be shown as a sequence of characters where:
- `.` indicates an unanswered question.
- `X` indicates a correct answer.
- `-` indicates an incorrect answer.

The final output will also show the total number of correct answers out of the total number of questions.

Example Output:
```
01/17 Guess TLD: ?
[.................] 00
```

After all questions are answered, the final result might look like:
```
[XX--X.X..X..X..X] 05
```
