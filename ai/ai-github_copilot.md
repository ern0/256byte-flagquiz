# Program Explanation

## Program Description
The program is a simple assembly language program that performs a series of operations, including clearing the screen, loading data, displaying a flag, and reading an answer. It repeats this process a total of 18 times before exiting.

## How It Works
1. The program starts by setting up the necessary environment. It sets the `bp` register to 0.
2. The program then calls the `clear_screen` subroutine to clear the screen.
3. Next, it enters a loop labeled `next_flag`. Within this loop, it calls the `load_data` subroutine to load the next data value into the `ax` register.
4. The program then calls the `display_flag` subroutine to display the flag based on the loaded data value.
5. After that, it calls the `read_answer` subroutine to read the user's answer.
6. The `bp` register is incremented by 1.
7. The program compares the value of `bp` with the constant `COUNT` (which is defined as 18). If `bp` is not equal to `COUNT`, the program jumps back to the `next_flag` label and repeats the process.
8. If `bp` is equal to `COUNT`, the program jumps to the `exit` label and terminates.

## Data Format
The program does not provide the specific details of the data format. However, based on the code provided, it can be inferred that the data is stored in a memory location pointed to by the `si` register. The `load_data` subroutine loads the next data value into the `ax` register using the `lodsw` instruction.

## Subroutines
The program uses three subroutines:
1. `clear_screen`: This subroutine clears the screen by setting the `ax` register to 0x0D and invoking the interrupt 0x10 with the `int` instruction. It then returns to the calling code.
2. `load_data`: This subroutine loads the next data value into the `ax` register using the `lodsw` instruction. It also moves the loaded value into the `bx` register. Additionally, it processes the data to prepare it for display.
3. `display_flag`: This subroutine displays the flag based on the value in the `bx` register. It calls the `display_strip` subroutine three times, each time shifting the `bx` register to process the next part of the flag.

## Register Usage
The program uses several registers:
- `bp`: This register is used as a counter to keep track of the number of iterations. It is incremented by 1 in each iteration.
- `ax`: This register is used to store the loaded data value and is also used as a general-purpose register.
- `bx`: This register is used to store the loaded data value and is used by the `display_flag` subroutine.
- `si`: This register is used to point to the data location in memory.
- `di`: This register is used to point to the destination for storing data.
- `cx`: This register is used as a counter for loops.
