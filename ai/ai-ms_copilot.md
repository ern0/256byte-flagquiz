# Assembly Program Analysis

## What the Program Does
This program appears to be a game or quiz that involves recognizing top-level domains (TLDs) such as `.cc`. It processes a data set, displays flag-like patterns on the screen, accepts user input to guess the TLD, and evaluates the answer. The game iterates through a defined number of flags (`COUNT`).

---

## How the Program Works
1. **Setup and Initialization**:
    - The program starts by setting `SI` to the address of the data array and clearing the `BP` register.
    - It calls a subroutine (`clear_screen`) to clear the display.

2. **Main Loop**:
    - The program enters a loop (`next_flag`) that processes `COUNT` items (17, as defined).
    - Inside the loop:
        - `load_data`: Loads a flag's data from the array.
        - `display_flag`: Displays the flag using a tricolor pattern.
        - `read_answer`: Asks the user to input their guess and validates it.
    - The loop continues until all flags are processed, then exits.

3. **Subroutines**:
    - `clear_screen`: Switches the display mode.
    - `load_data`: Reads two bytes of flag data into the `BX` register, processes it, and stores a value in `print_tld`.
    - `display_flag`: Creates a flag pattern using the `display_strip` subroutine.
    - `display_strip`: Displays horizontal strips of the flag using graphical interrupts.
    - `read_answer`: Handles user input and evaluates their answer.
    - `read_key`: Reads a keystroke from the user.

4. **Exit**:
    - The program exits gracefully by invoking interrupt `20H`.

## Data Format
- **Flag Data**: Stored in the `data` section as bytes, with each flag taking up multiple bytes.
- **Print Strings**:
  - `print_question`: Text prompt for the user ("Guess TLD:").
  - `print_space`, `print_backspace`, and others for formatting and user interaction.
- **Result Buffer**: Stores the results of the user's answers.
- **`num`**: Tracks the current flag number (e.g., `00/17`).

## Subroutines and Their Purpose
| Subroutine      | Description                                                   |
|------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| `clear_screen`   | Clears the screen and sets the display mode using interrupt `10H`. |
| `load_data`      | Loads flag data into registers, processes it, and prepares it for display. |
| `display_flag`   | Creates a tricolor flag pattern by calling `display_strip`.   |
| `display_strip`  | Displays a horizontal stripe on the screen using graphical interrupts. |
| `read_answer`    | Manages user input and checks it against the expected TLD.    |
| `read_key`       | Reads and processes a single keystroke.                      |
| `exit`           | Terminates the program using interrupt `20H`.                |

## Register Usage
| Register | Usage                                                                 |
|----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `AX`     | General-purpose register used for calculations and interrupt calls.   |
| `BX`     | Stores flag data and intermediate values during display processing.   |
| `CX`     | Used as a counter for loops.                                          |
| `DX`     | Used for displaying text and handling user input.                     |
| `SI`     | Points to the current data in the `data` section.                     |
| `DI`     | Used for storing processed data in memory (e.g., `print_tld`).        |
| `BP`     | Tracks the current flag index.                                        |

This program creatively utilizes BIOS and DOS interrupts to handle both graphical output and user input efficiently.
