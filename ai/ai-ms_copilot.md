# Program Explanation

## Main Function
The main purpose of this program is to display flags, read user inputs, evaluate their answers, and track the results. It operates in a loop, processing a predefined number of flags (`COUNT`) and interacts with the user through the console.

## Program Flow
1. **Initialization:**
   - Starts at address `100H`.
   - Registers `SI` and `DI` are initialized to point to `data` and `result` sections, respectively.
   - The screen is cleared with `clear_screen` subroutine.

2. **Main Loop (`next_flag`):**
   - Calls the following subroutines:
     - `load_flag_data`: Loads flag data from `data` into `print_tld`.
     - `display_flag`: Displays the flag's tricolor strip.
     - `read_answer`: Waits for and captures the user's input.
     - `evaluate_answer`: Compares the user's input with the expected value and records the result in the `result` section.
   - Repeats until all flags (`COUNT`) are processed.

3. **Exit:**
   - Ends with an interrupt call (`int 20H`).

## Data Format
1. **Constants:**
   - `COUNT`: Defines the total number of flags to process.
   - `NONE_SIGN`, `PASS_SIGN`, `FAIL_SIGN`: Characters used to represent the evaluation results.
   - Control characters: `BS` (Backspace), `CR` (Carriage Return), `LF` (Line Feed), `ESC` (Escape).

2. **Data Section:**
   - `data`: Stores flag information in triplets.
   - `result`: Stores the evaluation results (`PASS_SIGN`, `FAIL_SIGN`, or `NONE_SIGN`) for each flag.

## Subroutines
1. **`clear_screen`:**
   - Clears the console display using interrupt `10H`.

2. **`load_flag_data`:**
   - Loads the flag's data and initializes the `print_tld` variable for display.

3. **`display_flag`:**
   - Displays a tricolor strip for the current flag based on its data.

4. **`display_strip`:**
   - Handles the rendering of each color strip for the flag.

5. **`read_answer`:**
   - Prompts the user for input and captures the answer.

6. **`evaluate_answer`:**
   - Compares the user's answer with the expected result and updates the results in memory.

7. **`inc2`:**
   - Handles incrementing numerical values, ensuring proper formatting.

## Register Usage
- **`SI`:** Points to the current flag data in `data`.
- **`DI`:** Points to the current position in the `result` section.
- **`AX`:** General-purpose accumulator, often used for temporary storage.
- **`BX`:** Temporary storage and processing of flag data.
- **`CX`:** Counter register, used for loops and data display.
- **`DX`:** Stores addresses for displaying strings.
- **`AH` / `AL`:** High/low parts of the `AX` register, often used for fine-grained operations.

## Notes
The program relies heavily on BIOS and DOS interrupts (`int 10H` and `int 21H`) for screen manipulation and input/output operations.
